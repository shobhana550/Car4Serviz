    </p>

    <p> <strong> Both User and Mobile Application are individually referred as 'party' to the agreement and collectively referred to as 'parties'.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2> Terminology: </h2>
    <p>
      1.	For the purpose of these Terms, wherever the context so requires "You" or "User" shall mean any natural or legal person who has agreed to become a buyer and/or availer of Facility being offered on the Mobile Application. </br> 2.

</p>
<h2> Our Mobile Application:</h2>
<p class="lead"> Clap-Serv wishes to clarify that it is only an online marketplace which merely connects the business to customers. In light of the foregoing,  Clap-Serv wishes to clarify the following:</p>

<p> 1.	The Mobile Application is a marketplace, which lists the inventory of Local/National/International Service Providers who are registered with the Mobile Application, but does not own the services per se. Hence, the role of the Mobile Application is to connect you and ‘Service Provider’. Further, the Mobile Application provides customer support in the event of complaints against Service Provider, cancellation of Service bookings, refunds and charge backs (responsibilities further mentioned in Clause 9, point 6).</br>
2.	In light of the foregoing, the Mobile Application shall assist you with any concerns and/or claims you may have in relation to the product being sold/services being offered on the Mobile Application in accordance with the applicable laws, and connect you with ‘seller’. However, you may always choose to pursue any such action as you may deem necessary against ‘seller’/the Mobile Application. In case of any deficiency of products/services, You agree to pursue any such action arising from such deficiency of products/services against ‘seller’ and not the Mobile Application.</br>
3.	You further agree and acknowledge that the Mobile Application cannot guarantee to or control in any manner any transactions on the Mobile Application. Accordingly, the contract of sale of products/services on the Mobile Application shall be a strictly bipartite contract between you and ‘seller’ listed on the Mobile Application. Any related issue, you can directly contact sellers customer support accordingly.</br>
4.	You further agree and acknowledge that all the 'discounts/coupons (if any)' on the Mobile Application/prices at which the products/services are being sold by the  Service Provider/hotel on the Mobile Application is merely an "invitation to treat" in accordance with the applicable laws and shall not be construed to be an "offer" in accordance with the applicable laws. Hence, in light of the foregoing, when you agree to purchase any product/services of the 'seller' listed on the Mobile Application, that would be termed as a 'valid offer' under the applicable laws and after doing so it is upon the 'seller' to accept the said 'valid offer' or reject the 'valid offer'. In this regard, note that if the 'seller' accepts the said 'valid offer', only then would it be tantamount to be a 'valid contract' as per the applicable laws.</br>
