    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>How is my personal information used?</strong> Your personal information is used to create and manage your Clap-Serv account, facilitate service requests, and improve our services. We do not share your information for marketing purposes.</li>

        <li><strong>Can I opt-out of data collection?</strong> Some data collection is necessary for using Clap-Serv. You can review and update your privacy settings within the app. However, certain information is required for the platform to function effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>How will I be notified of policy changes?</strong> We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy via email or through the Clap-Serv app. It's important to review these updates to stay informed about how your information is handled.</li>
        <li><strong>How is Clap-Serv helpful for riders?</strong> Clap-Serv is a long term sustainable solution for the city's service provider's and employment requirements for talented users. Radical tech and marketing innovations will reduce overall costs and its benefits will flow to service proiders and users. And having an open revenue model will further improve the efficiency, affordability and interoperability.</li>
        <li><strong>Who decides the product roadmap?</strong> The board member and the team along with user's feedback enables us to create an efficient and helpful roadmap for everyone on this platform. </li>
        <li><strong>What is the monetisation strategy for Clap-Serv?</strong> The core innovation in this initiative is radically reducing the cost structure of the critical components like bringing the seeker and the provider together. This is helping us to convert from a high commission based model to a very nominal fee for the service providers to present them an oppourtunity to bid for the service need presented by the user. </li>
        <li><strong>How is Yatri different from ride aggregators?</strong> Clap-Serv is a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform for service providers of all kinds. It follows a P2P (Peer to Peer) model and runs on an Open Network to enable service providers to connect directly with customers and provide their service. The customer directly pays the service provider at the end of the service against the invoice raised by the driver. Unlike other service provider aggregators, Clap-Serv neither controls the pricing nor charges any commission or subscription to them. Service providers pay a small fee as small as 5 rs to clap-serv for using the tech platform and bid for the service need of a customer.</li>
        <li><strong>How do you handle cancellation issues?</strong> Cancellation can typically happen at both ends and it's purely between service providers and the customer based on their discussion over phone. Once the proposal from service provider gets accepted by the customer, app exposes the contact information of both the parties to each other. They can contact over phone and establish all other norms of their business among themselves. Clap-Serv do not intervene thereafter. </li>
        <li><strong>How is the payment collected from the customer and paid to the service provider?</strong> Customers can directly pay the service provider at the end of the service rendered via cash, UPI, etc. Clap-Serv do not get involved in the collection of service fare from the customer and payment to the service provider. Clap-Serv is a SaaS platform for the drivers following a P2P Network model.</li>
        <li><strong>Who issues the invoice?</strong> Clap-Serv do not invoice customers. The responsibility of sharing invoices is with service provider if they want. However, if user selects branded vendor, typically vendor at the end of the service provides invoices. We only collect nominal fee from service provider to present the oppourtunity of bidding a customer service request</li>
        <li><strong>Who decides the pricing on Clap-Serv for a service?</strong> It's purely from service provider, just like old days when you ask providers to provide quote to them for the service request and based on the features, quality, review customer used to select providers, Clap-Serv exactly works like that. </li>
